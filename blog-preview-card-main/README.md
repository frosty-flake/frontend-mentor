## Overview

Another simple HTML and CSS exercise for Frontend Mentor. In this one,
we use a :hover pseudo-class to have the header change color on hover.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I built this by structuring the HTML first, then building the CSS from
outside in.

Noticing that the yellow color was used many times, I used a CSS custom
property to give it a name.

I use Flexbox to make the card more adaptable to smaller device widths.

I placed the image as a background for a div instead, so that it will
automatically shrink when the card is narrower.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
