## My process

I started by building out the HTML, creating a container div to contain 
the image and text. Then, I decorated it with CSS, starting from the 
outermost components.

To make the design responsive, I used Flexbox, and I set the container 
width to be at most 95% of the view width.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

One thing I learnt is that a flex container needs to have a set width to
use justify-content properly.

Other than that, I learnt a little bit of responsive design, and I was 
able to practice some basic HTML and CSS.
